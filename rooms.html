<p style="text-align:left"> Our rooms are different from any hotels in that they are owned and leased. As such, <br>
they have their own individual appeal based on the interior design offered by the owner. <br>
They are meant to feel like your "home away from home." It is as if you are the owner <br>
of this unique property and the building and all its amenities are at your beck and call. <br>
All rooms have a unique perspective of the beach and surrounding areas. </p>
